# MLB-Data-Analysis
Small data analysis project from a high school class that involved using python's statistics libraries to analyze baseball statistics. The assigned project was simply to do some form of data analysis on any dataset that interested us and for me, analysing baseball statistics was a no-brainer.

The project involved using a dataset with around 45,000 cells of data which contained 133 statistics for 337 batters for the 2008 Major League Baseball season. The project involved answering a couple questions such as finding the most correlated statistic to salary and exploring which defensive position yields the best batters. Additionally, this was an opportunity to learn how to use Jupyter Notebook to make the findings and conclusions more presentable.
